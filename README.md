# 🧠 Smart Task Tracker

A Python-based command-line application that helps users manage tasks with priorities, due dates, and automatic reminders for urgent tasks. Built with a strong focus on object-oriented programming, clean code architecture, and technical clarity.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Add, edit, and delete tasks
- 🗓 Assign due dates and track deadlines
- ⚠️ Priority levels: Low, Medium, High
- 🔔 Reminders for high-priority or overdue tasks
- 📁 Persistent storage using JSON
- 🔍 Filter tasks by due date, status, or priority

## 🎯 Learning Goals Demonstrated

This project applies and goes beyond the core Python concepts taught in the curriculum:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Tasks are represented as class instances, with behaviors encapsulated in methods.
- **Data Structures**: Uses lists and dictionaries to manage and organize task data.
- **File I/O**: Implements persistent storage using JSON files to save and load task information.
- **Datetime Handling**: Uses the `datetime` module to track due dates and determine urgency.
- **Control Flow**: Extensive use of loops, conditionals, and function calls to manage program logic.
- **Modular Design**: Organized into multiple files and directories to ensure clean architecture and separation of concerns.
